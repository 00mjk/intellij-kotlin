## Building

To build this project you need to run

    ant -f update_dependencies.xml

which will setup the dependencies on

* intellij-core: is a part of command line compiler and contains only necessary APIs.
* idea-full: is a full blown IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to be used in former plugin module.

Then, you need to run

    ant -f build.xml
    
which will build the binaries and put them into the 'dist' directory.
