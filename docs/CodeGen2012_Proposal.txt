Code Generation 2012 - Session Proposal Form

Submission Deadline: Friday December 9th 2011

Session title:
Creating DSLs in Kotlin

Session type and duration:
Tutorial, 60 min

Session abstract:
This should be a brief description of the session focusing on its content and objectives.  You will need to cut and paste this text into a web form as part of the submission process. The session abstract will be used on the event web site to promote your session.

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for the JVM proposed recently by JetBrains. The language is intended for industrial use as a safer and more convenient alternative to Java. One can even mix Kotlin and Java sources in the same project. Language documentation is available at http://jetbrains.com/kotlin.

In this session we will demonstrate Kotlin's abilities to define APIs as domain-specific languages (DSLs). This includes covering many interesting language features such as
* type inference,
* function literals (closures),
* operator overloading/overriding,
* extension functions
* and moreâ€¦

As a flagship example we will present type-safe builders, a technique that improves upon Groovy builders (http://groovy.codehaus.org/Builders) by making them statically checked for correctness. Along with this example we'll demonstrate LINQ-like collection processing and a DSL for program module definitions.
